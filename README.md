# etl-tool

## Overview

etl-tool is a command-line application for performing Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) operations. It reads data from various sources, applies transformations based on a configuration file, and writes the results to various destinations.

## Features

*   Configuration-driven ETL processes using YAML.
*   Supports multiple data sources: CSV, JSON, XLSX, XML, YAML, PostgreSQL.
*   Supports multiple data destinations: CSV, JSON, XLSX, XML, YAML, PostgreSQL.
*   Data filtering capabilities using expressions.
*   Record transformation and validation rules.
*   Data deduplication based on specified keys and strategies.
*   Configurable error handling (halt or skip).
*   Optional FIPS compliance mode.
*   Dry-run mode to preview actions without writing data.
*   Environment variable expansion in configuration paths and connection strings.

## Usage

etl-tool -config <config_file.yaml> [options]

## Key Options

*   `-config string`: Path to the YAML configuration file (default: "config/etl-config.yaml").
*   `-input string`: Override the input file path specified in the config (ignored for source type 'postgres').
*   `-output string`: Override the output file path/table specified in the config (ignored for destination type 'postgres').
*   `-db string`: PostgreSQL connection string (overrides DB_CREDENTIALS environment variable).
*   `-loglevel string`: Logging level (none, error, warn, info, debug) (default: "info").
*   `-dry-run`: Perform all steps except writing to the destination.
*   `-fips`: Enable FIPS compliance mode.
*   `-help`: Show the help message.

## Environment Variables

*   `DB_CREDENTIALS`: PostgreSQL connection string (used if -db flag is not set).
*   Other variables (e.g., `$MY_PATH`, `${VAR_NAME}`, `%WIN_PATH%`) can be used within configuration file paths and connection strings for expansion.

## Building and Testing

*   Build: `go build -o etl-tool ./cmd/etl-tool/main.go`
*   Run Tests: `go test ./...`
*   Run Tests (Docker): `./docker-test.sh`

This tool was designed to address a gap I saw in existing automation tools. Golang seemed like the best choice to accomplish my goals, but my experience has been with other programming languages. Iâ€™ve leveraged AI for assistance with coding and as a way to teach myself a new language while building something useful. The overall design, architecture, and direction are entirely my own.
