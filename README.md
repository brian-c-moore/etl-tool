# ETL Tool

A generic Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) utility for extracting data from various sources, applying configurable transformations, deduplicating records, and loading the processed data into a destination. The tool is configured via a YAML file and supports multiple input and output formats.

## Features

- Multi-Source Input: Read data from JSON, CSV, XLSX, XML files or from PostgreSQL using SQL queries.
- Flexible Transformation: Apply a variety of built-in transformations (e.g., epoch-to-date, regex extraction, case conversion) using mapping rules.
- Deduplication: Optionally deduplicate records based on composite keys.
- Multiple Output Destinations: Load data to PostgreSQL tables (using COPY or custom SQL) or to file formats (CSV, XLSX, XML, JSON).
- Customizable Loading: Use custom SQL commands with preload, postload, and batching options when writing to PostgreSQL.
- Configurable Logging: Set logging levels (none, info, debug) to control verbosity.

## Requirements

- Go 1.18 or later
- PostgreSQL (if using database sources or destinations)
- Libraries: pgx, govaluate, excelize, yaml

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

       git clone https://your-repository-url.git
       cd etl-tool

2. Build the project:

       go build -o etl-tool .

3. (Optional) Set environment variables (e.g., DB_CREDENTIALS)

## Configuration

The tool is configured via a YAML file. The configuration file is divided into these main sections:

### source

Defines the input data source.

- type: (Required) Input source type. Valid values:
  - json (JSON file)
  - csv (CSV file)
  - xlsx (Excel file)
  - xml (XML file)
  - postgres (PostgreSQL query)
- file: (Required for file-based sources) Path to the input file.
- query: (Required for postgres) SQL query to execute.

### destination

Defines the output data destination.

- type: (Required) Destination type. Valid values:
  - postgres (PostgreSQL table)
  - csv (CSV file)
  - xlsx (Excel file)
  - xml (XML file)
  - json (JSON file)
- target_table: (Required for postgres) Name of the target database table.
- file: (Required for file-based destinations) Path to the output file.
- loader: (Optional, for postgres) Additional options for loading data:
  - mode: Loader mode (e.g., sql to use custom SQL commands).
  - command: (Required if mode is sql) The custom SQL command to execute.
  - preload: List of SQL commands to run before loading.
  - postload: List of SQL commands to run after loading.
  - batch_size: Number of records per batch when using custom SQL.

### mappings

An ordered list of mapping rules that transform the input records.

Each mapping rule includes:
- source: (Required) Field name in the input record.
- target: (Required) Field name in the output record.
- transform: (Optional) Transformation function to apply (e.g., "regexExtract:pattern").
- params: (Optional) Additional parameters required by the transform.

### dedup

(Optional) Deduplication settings.

- keys: (Required) List of field names used to form a composite key for deduplication.

## Usage

Run the tool with the following command-line options:

       etl-tool -config config/etl-config.yaml -input /path/to/input.csv -db "postgres://user:password@host:port/dbname" -loglevel info

Command-line options:

- -config: Path to the YAML configuration file (default: config/etl-config.yaml).
- -input: (Optional) Override the input file path specified in the configuration.
- -db: PostgreSQL connection string. If not provided, the tool will use the DB_CREDENTIALS environment variable.
- -loglevel: Logging level (none, info, debug).

## Logging

The tool supports these logging levels:

- none: No logging output.
- info: Basic informational messages.
- debug: Detailed debug messages.

Set the log level using the -loglevel option.

## Acknowledgments
This tool was designed to address a gap I saw in existing automation tools. Golang seemed like the best choice to accomplish my goals, but my experience has been with other programming languages. Iâ€™ve leveraged ChatGPT for assistance with coding and as a way to teach myself a new language while building something useful. The overall design, architecture, and direction are entirely my own.
